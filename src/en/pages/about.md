I'm a full-stack web developer whose focus leans more towards front-end development. I work with accessibility in mind, by ensuring that it's properly implemented in new sites, and by retrofitting improvements into existing sites. I enjoy writing modern CSS and am keen to learn more about how the web can be made cleaner & greener.

I'm from the UK, but these days I live in Tampere, Finland. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

## About my work

Professionally, I have always used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as the foundation of the sites I have built and worked on for clients. Outside of my job, I enjoy experimenting with side projects, for which I have recently been using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

Have a peek at some of [my stuff](/{{locale}}/work). ðŸ‘€

## About my hobbies

When I'm not coding, I love playing the guitar and listening to metal music (although, actually, I listen to metal while I'm coding too). I also enjoy landscape photography, have a look at [George Hieron Photography](https://www.georgehieron.com/) if you'd like to see some of my images. ðŸ“·

Apart from all that, I'm really interested in medieval history (particularly the Viking age), and learning languages. I can speak some Norwegian, some Finnish, and even some Old Norse. ðŸ“œ
