I'm a full-stack web developer whose focus leans more towards front-end development. I specialise in accessibility, whether that's ensuring it's properly implemented in new sites, or retrofitting accessibility improvements into existing sites. I enjoy writing modern CSS and am interested in learning more about how the web can be made cleaner, greener and more sustainable.

I'm from the UK, but these days I live in Tampere, Finland. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

## A bit about my work

Professionally, I have always used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as the foundation of the sites I have built and worked on for clients. Outside of my job, I enjoy creating the odd fun side project, for which I have recently been using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

Have a peek at some of [my stuff](/{{locale}}/work). ðŸ‘€

## A bit about my hobbies

When I'm not coding, I love playing the electric guitar and listening to metal music. I also love landscape photography, and while I haven't been doing this as much as I'd like, these days I'm making an effort to get out and shoot out more often. Have a look at [George Hieron Photography](https://www.georgehieron.com/), my other website, if you'd like to see some of my images. ðŸ“·

Apart from all that, I'm really interested in medieval history (particularly the Viking age), and learning languages. I can speak some Norwegian, some Finnish, and have also studied Old Norse. ðŸ“œ

As you might have already noticed, sometimes I like to make these interests collide with coding!
