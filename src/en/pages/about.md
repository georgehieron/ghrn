I work with accessibility in mind, by ensuring that it's properly implemented in new sites, and by retrofitting improvements into existing sites. I enjoy writing modern CSS and am keen to learn more about how the web can be made cleaner & greener.

I'm from the UK, but these days I live in Tampere, Finland. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

<h2 class="align-cente">About my work</h2>

Professionally, I have always used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as the foundation of the sites I have built and worked on for clients. Outside of my job, I enjoy experimenting with other technologies in side projects; lately, I have been using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator, in addition to [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

Have a peek at some of [my stuff](/{{locale}}/work). ðŸ‘€

<h2 class="align-cente">About my hobbies</h2>

When I'm not coding, I love playing the guitar and listening to metal music (although, actually, I listen to metal while I'm coding too). I also enjoy landscape photography, have a look at [George Hieron Photography](https://www.georgehieron.com/) if you'd like to see some of my images. ðŸ“·

Apart from all that, I'm really interested in medieval history (particularly the Viking age), and learning languages. I can speak Norwegian, Finnish, a little Swedish and Danish, and even some Old Norse. ðŸ“œ
