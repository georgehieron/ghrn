I'm George Hieron, a full-stack web developer whose focus leans more towards front-end development. I specialise in accessibility, ensuring it is always a consideration in new sites and retrofitting accessibility improvements into existing sites. I enjoy writing modern CSS and am interested in learning more about how the web can be made cleaner, greener and more sustainable.

I am British, and based in Tampere, Finland.
