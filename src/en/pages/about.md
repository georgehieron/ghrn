I'm George Hieron, a full-stack web developer whose focus leans more towards front-end development. I specialise in accessibility, whether that's ensuring it's properly implemented in new sites, or retrofitting accessibility improvements into existing sites. I enjoy writing modern CSS and am interested in learning more about how the web can be made cleaner, greener and more sustainable.

I am British, and based in Tampere, Finland.

## A bit about my work

In my professional work, I have always used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as the foundation of the sites I have built and worked on for clients. More recently, I have started to experiment with static site generators, primarily [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and have created some small and fun side-projects using it. Check out [my work](/{{locale}}/work) to see what I've come up with.

## A bit about my hobbies

When I'm not coding, I love playing the electric guitar and listening to metal music. I also love landscape photography, and while I haven't been doing this as much as I'd like, these days I'm making an effort to get out and shoot out more often. Have a look at [George Hieron Photography](https://www.georgehieron.com/), my other website, if you'd like to see some of my images.

Apart from all that, I'm really interested in medieval history (particularly the Viking age), and learning languages. I can speak some Norwegian, some Finnish, and have also studied Old Norse.
