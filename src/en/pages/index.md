# Hey, I'm George.

I am a front-end focused web developer from Bristol, UK. I'm based in Tampere, Finland, working as a WordPress developer for [Geniem](https://www.geniem.fi/in-english/). I specialise in accessibility and love to use modern CSS techniques. I am also interested in making the web more green and sustainable.


## About my work

Professionally, I have always worked with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) to make bespoke sites for clients. Outside of work, I enjoy creating the odd fun side project, for which I have mostly been using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

Have a peek at some of [my work](/{{locale}}/work) ðŸ‘€
