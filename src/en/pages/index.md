I am a front-end-focused web developer from Bristol, UK. I'm based in Tampere, Finland, working as a WordPress developer for [Geniem](https://www.geniem.fi/in-english/). I specialise in accessibility and love to use modern CSS techniques. I am also interested in making the web more green and sustainable. ðŸŒ²
